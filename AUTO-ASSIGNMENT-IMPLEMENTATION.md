# Automatic Campaign Assignment - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
Implemented a fully automatic campaign assignment system where campaigns are instantly matched and deployed to hosts without manual opt-in.

## Architecture

### 1. Campaign Matching Service (`campaignMatcher.ts`)
**Purpose:** Find compatible hosts for campaigns based on targeting criteria

**Key Features:**
- Follower range matching (supports formats like "1k-10k", "10k+", "1000-5000")
- Category/niche matching
- CPM rate matching
- Status filtering (active hosts only)
- Duplicate placement prevention

**Main Methods:**
- `findMatchingHosts(campaignId)` - Find all compatible hosts for a campaign
- `assignCampaignToHost(campaignId, hostId)` - Create ad placement
- `autoAssignCampaign(campaignId)` - Assign campaign to all matching hosts

### 2. Farcaster Posting Service (`farcasterPosting.ts`)
**Purpose:** Deploy ads to Farcaster profiles (banner + pinned cast)

**Key Features:**
- Post pinned casts with campaign creative
- Update profile banners
- Remove ads when campaigns end
- Store deployment metadata (cast hash, banner URL, timestamps)

**Main Methods:**
- `postPinnedCast(hostId, campaignId)` - Post and pin a cast
- `updateProfileBanner(hostId, campaignId)` - Update profile banner
- `deployAdToHost(hostId, campaignId)` - Deploy all ad types
- `removeAdFromHost(hostId, campaignId)` - Clean up when campaign ends

**Note:** Currently uses mock implementations. Real Farcaster API integration requires:
- Farcaster Hub API for posting casts
- Farcaster API for updating profile banners
- Host Mini App permissions for posting on behalf of users

### 3. Auto-Assignment Service (`autoAssignment.ts`)
**Purpose:** Orchestrate the complete assignment and deployment flow

**Key Features:**
- Process funded campaigns → match → assign → deploy
- Process new hosts → match with active campaigns
- Complete campaigns and remove ads from all hosts
- Periodic matching to catch any missed assignments

**Main Methods:**
- `processFundedCampaign(campaignId)` - Triggered when campaign is funded
- `processNewHost(hostId)` - Triggered when host completes onboarding
- `completeCampaign(campaignId)` - End campaign and clean up
- `runPeriodicMatching()` - Catch-up job (can be run as cron)

## Database Models

### Host Model (Updated)
```typescript
{
  userId: ObjectId,
  farcasterId: number,
  username: string,
  displayName: string,
  followerCount: number,
  status: 'active' | 'inactive' | 'paused',
  acceptingCampaigns: boolean, // Default: true
  
  // Preferences
  adTypes: ['banner', 'pinned_cast'],
  categories: string[], // Empty = accept all
  minimumCPM: number, // 0 = accept all
  
  // Mini App
  miniAppPermissionsGranted: boolean,
  lastPermissionUpdate: Date,
  
  // Earnings
  totalEarnings: number,
  pendingEarnings: number
}
```

### AdPlacement Model (Updated)
```typescript
{
  campaignId: ObjectId,
  hostId: ObjectId,
  advertiserId: ObjectId,
  adType: 'banner' | 'pinned_cast' | 'both',
  status: 'pending' | 'active' | 'completed' | 'cancelled',
  
  // Dates
  startDate: Date,
  endDate: Date,
  
  // Pricing
  pricing: {
    cpm: number,
    totalBudget: number
  },
  
  // Performance
  performance: {
    impressions: number,
    clicks: number,
    earnings: number
  },
  
  // Deployment metadata
  metadata: {
    castHash: string, // For pinned casts
    postedAt: Date,
    bannerUrl: string, // For banner ads
    bannerUpdatedAt: Date
  }
}
```

## User Flow

### Advertiser Creates Campaign
1. Advertiser fills out campaign form
2. Campaign created with status 'active'
3. **Auto-assignment triggers immediately:**
   - Find all hosts matching targeting criteria
   - Create `AdPlacement` for each matched host
   - Deploy ads to all matched hosts (banner/pinned cast)
   - Send notifications to hosts
4. Campaign goes live on all matched host profiles

**Code:** `apps/backend/src/routes/campaigns.ts` (POST /api/campaigns)
```typescript
await campaign.save();

// Auto-assign campaign to matching hosts (async, don't wait)
(async () => {
  const { autoAssignment } = await import('../services/autoAssignment');
  await autoAssignment.processFundedCampaign(campaign._id.toString());
})();
```

### Host Onboarding
1. User signs in with Farcaster ✅
2. Set preferences:
   - Ad types (banner, pinned_cast)
   - Categories/niches (optional)
   - Minimum CPM (default: 0)
   - Auto-accept campaigns (default: ON)
3. Grant Mini App permissions
4. Status set to "active" and accepting campaigns
5. **Auto-assignment triggers:**
   - Find all active campaigns matching host criteria
   - Create `AdPlacement` for each matched campaign
   - Deploy ads to host profile
   - Send notifications to host

**Code:** `apps/backend/src/routes/hosts.ts` (POST /api/hosts/onboard)
```typescript
await host.save();

// Trigger auto-assignment for this new host
(async () => {
  const { autoAssignment } = await import('../services/autoAssignment');
  await autoAssignment.processNewHost(host._id.toString());
})();
```

### Campaign Ends
1. Campaign status changed to 'completed'
2. **Auto-removal triggers:**
   - Find all active placements for this campaign
   - Unpin casts and delete them
   - Revert profile banners to original
   - Mark placements as 'completed'

**Code:** Can be triggered manually or via cron job
```typescript
await autoAssignment.completeCampaign(campaignId);
```

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/campaigns
Create campaign → Auto-assigns to matching hosts

### POST /api/hosts/onboard
Host onboarding → Auto-assigns active campaigns

### GET /api/campaigns/advertiser/:advertiserId
Get campaigns for advertiser (shows assignments)

### GET /api/campaigns?status=active
Get active campaigns (for hosts to see what's running on their profile)

## Frontend Components

### Host Onboarding (`apps/frontend/src/app/host/onboarding/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Real Farcaster authentication
- ✅ 3-step wizard (Profile, Preferences, Review)
- ✅ Ad type selection (banner, pinned_cast)
- ✅ Category/niche selection (optional)
- ✅ Minimum CPM input
- ✅ Auto-accept toggle (default ON)
- ✅ Triggers auto-assignment on completion

### Campaign Creation (`CreateCampaignModalDetailed.tsx`)
- ✅ Already implemented
- ✅ Auto-triggers assignment after creation

### Dashboard (`RoleBasedDashboard.tsx`)
- ✅ Shows campaigns for advertisers (campaigns they created)
- ✅ Shows campaigns for hosts (campaigns active on their profile)
- ✅ Real-time campaign table with status

## Matching Algorithm

The matching algorithm considers these factors:

1. **Host Status:** Must be `status: 'active'` and `acceptingCampaigns: true`
2. **Follower Range:** Host follower count must fall within campaign's target range
3. **Categories:** If specified, host categories must overlap with campaign categories (or host has no restrictions)
4. **CPM:** Host's minimum CPM must be ≤ campaign's offered CPM (or host has no minimum)
5. **No Conflicts:** Host doesn't already have this campaign assigned

**Example Matching Query:**
```typescript
const hostQuery = {
  status: 'active',
  acceptingCampaigns: { $ne: false },
  followerCount: { $gte: 1000, $lte: 10000 },
  $or: [
    { categories: { $in: ['tech', 'crypto'] } },
    { categories: { $exists: false } },
    { categories: { $size: 0 } }
  ],
  $or: [
    { minimumCPM: { $lte: 5.00 } },
    { minimumCPM: { $exists: false } },
    { minimumCPM: 0 }
  ]
};
```

## Deployment Workflow

### When Campaign Goes Live:
```
Campaign Created
    ↓
Auto-Assignment Service
    ↓
Campaign Matcher ← finds compatible hosts
    ↓
Create AdPlacements (one per host)
    ↓
Farcaster Posting Service
    ↓
[For each host]
├─ Post pinned cast (if type = pinned_cast)
│  └─ Store castHash in placement.metadata
├─ Update profile banner (if type = banner)
│  └─ Store bannerUrl in placement.metadata
└─ Send notification to host
```

### When Host Joins:
```
Host Onboards
    ↓
Auto-Assignment Service
    ↓
Find all active campaigns
    ↓
Campaign Matcher ← filters by host criteria
    ↓
[For each matched campaign]
├─ Create AdPlacement
├─ Deploy ads to host profile
└─ Send notification
```

## Testing the Flow

1. Sign in with Farcaster
2. Go to `/host/onboarding`
3. Set preferences:
   - Ad types: Banner + Pinned Cast
   - Categories: (leave empty for all)
   - Minimum CPM: 0
   - Auto-accept: ON
4. Complete onboarding
5. Check backend logs for auto-assignment

### 2. Create a Test Campaign

    console.log('🔄 Running periodic matching...');
    await autoAssignment.runPeriodicMatching();
  }
);
periodicMatchingJob.start();
```

## Summary

✅ **Completed:**
- Campaign matching algorithm with advanced targeting
- Automatic campaign assignment on creation
- Automatic campaign assignment for new hosts
- Farcaster posting service (mock implementation)
- Host onboarding UI with preferences
- Updated database models
- API endpoints for onboarding and assignment
- Integration triggers in campaign and host routes

⚠️ **Pending:**
- Real Farcaster API integration (currently mocked)
- Blockchain event listening for funding detection
- Real notification system (currently logged)
- Periodic matching cron job (method exists, not scheduled)

🎯 **Result:**
The auto-assignment flow is fully functional and ready to test. When advertisers create campaigns or hosts complete onboarding, the system automatically matches and deploys ads without any manual intervention. The only remaining work is integrating real Farcaster APIs and blockchain event listeners.
