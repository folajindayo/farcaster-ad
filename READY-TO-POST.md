## 🚀 How to Make a REAL Post

### Step 1: Get Neynar API Key (5 minutes)

1. **Sign up**: Go to https://dev.neynar.com/
2. **Create API Key**: Dashboard → API Keys → Create New
3. **Copy Key**: It looks like `NEYNAR-...`
4. **Add to env**:

```bash
# Edit this file
nano /Users/mac/farcaster-ad-rental/apps/backend/.env.local

# Add this line
NEYNAR_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Step 2: Create Signer for @kamoru (10 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/mac/farcaster-ad-rental/apps/backend

# Create signer
npm run signer:create 802617
```

**Output:**
```
✅ Signer created successfully!

📋 Signer Details:
   Signer UUID: abc-123-xyz
   Status: pending_approval

🔗 Authorization Required:
   Visit this URL to authorize the signer:
   https://neynar.com/signer/abc-123-xyz

⏱️  Steps:
   1. Open the URL above in your browser
   2. Sign in with Warpcast as @kamoru
   3. Authorize the signer
   4. Come back and run:
      npm run signer:add 802617 "abc-123-xyz"
```

### Step 3: Add Signer to Host (1 minute)

After authorizing via the URL:

```bash
npm run signer:add 802617 "your-signer-uuid"
```

**Output:**
```
✅ Signer added successfully!

🚀 Ready to post!
```

### Step 4: Make the Post! (Instant)

```bash
npm run assign:campaign "Blaze"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🚀 Publishing cast via Neynar for signer: abc-123-xyz
✅ Cast published successfully! Hash: 0x...
   View at: https://warpcast.com/kamoru/0x...

🎉 Campaign successfully deployed to 1 hosts
```

**The post will appear on @kamoru's Farcaster profile! 🎊**

## 🔍 Verification

### Check if Signer is Ready
```bash
npm run signer:check 802617
```

### Check Campaign Status
```bash
npm run campaign:check "Blaze"
```

### Check Host Status
```bash
npm run debug:hosts
```

## 📝 What the Post Will Look Like

Based on the campaign "Blaze Africa LTD":

```
🎯 Blaze Africa LTD

[Campaign description if set]

Learn More: [CTA URL if set]

[Banner image embed]
```

The banner image will be displayed: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1614332287897-cdc485fa562d?w=1200&h=400&fit=crop

## 🎯 Quick Start (TL;DR)

```bash
# 1. Add API key to .env.local
echo 'NEYNAR_API_KEY=your_key' >> apps/backend/.env.local

# 2. Create & authorize signer
cd apps/backend
npm run signer:create 802617
# → Visit authorization URL
# → Sign in as @kamoru
# → Authorize

# 3. Add signer to host
npm run signer:add 802617 "your-signer-uuid"

# 4. Make the post!
npm run assign:campaign "Blaze"

# 5. Check Warpcast
# → Go to https://warpcast.com/kamoru
# → See the post! 🎉
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Neynar API not configured"
**Fix:** Add `NEYNAR_API_KEY` to `.env.local` and restart backend

### "Host has not authorized a signer"
**Fix:** Run `npm run signer:create 802617` and authorize via URL

### "Failed to post cast"
- Check signer is authorized
- Verify API key is valid
- Run `npm run signer:check 802617`

### "Banner deployment failed"
- This is expected - banner updates require special permissions
- The cast will still post successfully!

## 📊 Alternative: Test First

Don't want to use real @kamoru account yet? Test with a different account:

1. Create a test Farcaster account
2. Add as host: `npm run fix:create-host`
3. Create signer for test account
4. Assign campaign to test account
5. Verify it works
6. Then set up for @kamoru

## 🎓 Understanding the Flow

```
1. Campaign Created
   ↓
2. Matched to Host (@kamoru)
   ↓
3. AdPlacement Created
   ↓
4. Neynar API Called
   ↓
5. Cast Posted to Farcaster ✅
   ↓
6. Post Appears on Profile 🎉
```

### Without Signer (Current):
```
1-3: ✅ Works
4: ⚠️ Mock posting (not real)
5-6: ❌ No post made
```

### With Signer (After setup):
```
1-3: ✅ Works
4: ✅ Real API call
5: ✅ Real post made
6: ✅ Post visible on Farcaster 🎊
```
