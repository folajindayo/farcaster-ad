# Role-Based Dashboard Fix & Campaign Activation

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Host Dashboard Routing ✅

**Problem:** When switching to Host role, users saw a basic dashboard instead of the full-featured host dashboard.

**Solution:** 
- Modified `/dashboard/page.tsx` to redirect hosts to `/host/dashboard` automatically
- Updated `RoleBasedDashboard.tsx` to redirect to `/host/dashboard` when switching to host role
- Now hosts get the full-featured dashboard with:
  - Earnings overview
  - Performance metrics
  - Ad slot management
  - Recent payouts
  - Real-time stats

**Files Changed:**
- `apps/frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- `apps/frontend/src/components/role-based/RoleBasedDashboard.tsx`

**Behavior:**
- ✅ Advertiser → Stays on `/dashboard` with advertiser view
- ✅ Host → Redirected to `/host/dashboard` with detailed host view
- ✅ Operator → Stays on `/dashboard` with operator view

### 2. Campaign Activation Script ✅

**Problem:** Need to activate campaign ID `8ebf4161` for "Blaze Africa LTD"

**Solution:** Created a powerful script that can:
- Activate any campaign by ID
- List all campaigns
- Search campaigns flexibly
- Show detailed campaign information

**File Created:**
- `apps/backend/src/scripts/activate-campaign.ts`

---

### Activate the Blaze Africa Campaign

```bash
cd apps/backend

# List all campaigns first (to see available campaigns)
npm run campaign:list

# Activate the campaign by ID

**Output:**
